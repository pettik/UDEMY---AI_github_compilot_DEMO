This project is a complete demo application that demonstrates the use of various AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI, and ChatGPT in a real-world development environment. It includes a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, a SQLite database for data storage, and various utility functions for authentication and file uploads. The application allows users to register, log in, create and manage events, and register for events.

For testing the API endpoints, the Postman application was used to send HTTP requests and verify the responses.
